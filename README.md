# NoughtsAndCrosses

I have attempted the Noughts And Crosses challenge.

The project contains the missing noughts and crosses class with the required methods, i have also created a database sub folder which contains a database class which handles all the database interaction aswell as a sql file which is a dump of the database.

if the commit names look inconsistent it may of been because i removed an email address i was no longer using as the primary to another and forgot to change it locally.
